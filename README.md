Work Along – Full Stack Task Management System (MERN)

TaskManager is a powerful full-stack task management web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), designed to streamline task organization and improve productivity. The platform enables users to create, assign, track, and manage tasks efficiently with real-time status updates and structured workflows.

The system supports features such as task prioritization, due dates, progress tracking, file attachments, and checklist management. It includes secure user authentication, role-based access control (Admin / Member), and an intuitive dashboard interface for monitoring task performance and analytics.

With a well-structured API architecture, protected routes, and responsive user interface, this project demonstrates scalable backend design, clean frontend integration, and real-world task management functionality suitable for teams and individual users.
